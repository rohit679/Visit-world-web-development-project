        <li> Paris was founded in the 3rd century BC and was previously called Lutetia.</li>
        <li>According to some, Lutetia was located in present-day Nanterre. The residents called themselves "Parisii" and therefore gave the name "Paris" to Lutetia.</li>

        </li>

        <li>The motto of Paris is "Fluctuat Ner Mergitur", which means "Tossed but not sunk" in Latin, referring to a ship.</li>
        <li>Because of its large area, the XVIth is the only one of Paris' arrondissements (municipal districts) to have two zip codes: 75016 and 75116.</li>
        <li>The rue du Pélican in the 1st arrondissement of Paris was originally called the "rue du Poile-Con". It was only in 1806 that this street was given its current name.</li>
        <li>There are dozens of pianos in the train stations of Paris. Initiated by the SNCF, the project "Play me I'm yours", is in numerous cities across the entire world.</li>
        <li>The regional train system in Paris was going to be called the "Métro Express Régional Défense-Étoile", which would have resulted in the initials M.E.R.D.E. But since that translates to "shit," the name was very quickly changed to "Réseau Express Régional".</li>

        <li>The statues all around the Place de la Concorde represent eight large cities of France: Lille, Strasbourg, Marseille, Nantes, Lyon, Brest, Bordeaux, and Rouen.</li>
        <li>At the Concorde metro station, there is an inscription with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1789. A piece created by the artist Françoise Schein in 1990: "Letter after letter, the text spreads out across the entire surface of the archway and the walls on the platform of line 12."</li>
        <li>The Roman numerals on the pavement of the Place de la Concorde are the numbers of a giant sundial, and the shadow of the obelisk functions to give the time.</li>
        <li>At 231 meters, the First tower, which is situated in the business quarter of La Défense, is the highest skyscraper in France.</li>
        <li>Likewise, the station Porte des Lilas (1921-1939) was established as a shuttle between the lines 3bis and 7bis. Today, it is used mostly for filming.</li>
